# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Fabian C. Moss is a postdoctoral researcher in the _Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab_ (DCML) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland). He was born in Cologne, Germany, and studied Mathematics and Educational Studies at University of Cologne, and Music Education (Major Piano) and Musicology at Hochschule für Musik und Tanz, Köln. Working with large symbolic datasets of musical scores and harmonic annotations, he is primarily interested in Computational Music Analysis, Music Theory, Music Cognition, and their mutual relationship.

I am a Research Fellow in Cultural Analytics at [University of Amsterdam](https://uva.nl) (UvA).
Working with large symbolic datasets of musical scores and harmonic annotations, I am primarily interested in Computational Music Analysis, Music Theory, Music Cognition, and their mutual relationship. My research is inherently interdisciplinary and aims to bridge the humanities and the sciences by drawing on methods and concepts from the Musicology and Music Theory, Mathematics, Music Information Retrieval, Data Science and Machine Learning, Music Psychology and Cognition, and the Digital Humanities.

Before my appointment at UvA, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab (DCML)](https://dcml.epfl.ch) at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://epfl.ch) (EPFL, Switzerland) for the project [*Distant Listening: The Development of Harmony over Three Centuries (1700–2000)*](https://dcml.epfl.ch/projects/distant-listening), funded by the [Swiss National Science Foundation](http://www.snf.ch) (PI: Martin Rohrmeier). I also directed the project [*Digitizing the Dualism Debate: A Case Study in the Computational Analysis of Historical Music Sources*](http://dcmlab.github.io/ddd) (with [François Bavaud](https://www.unil.ch/sli/francoisbavaud) and [Coline Métrailler](https://www.unil.ch/sli/home/menuinst/collaborateurtrices/metrailler-coline.html), Université de Lausanne), supported by the EPFL-UNIL funding scheme [CROSS - Collaborative Research on Science and Society](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdh/research-2/cross-collaborative-research-on-science-and-society/).
