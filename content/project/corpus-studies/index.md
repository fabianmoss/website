title: "Corpus Studies and Stylometry"
summary: "A main area of my research is **corpus studies**: the computational analysis 
of large datasets of musical pieces. 
The overarching goal is to better understand patterns that transcend an individual 
work or piece, and that can be attributed to a composer's style or to even farther-reaching 
patterns, such as historical changes in tonality."
