abstract: "A major locus of musicological activity—increasingly in the digital
  domain—is the cataloguing of sources, which requires large-scale
  and long-lasting research collaborations. Yet, despite decades of
  effort, the databases aiming at covering and representing musical
  repertoires are never quite complete, and scholars must contend
  with the question: how much are we still missing? This question
  structurally resembles the ‘unseen species’ problem in ecology,
  where the true number of species must be estimated from limited
  observations. In this case study, we apply for the first time the
  common Chao1 estimator to music, specifically to Gregorian chant.
  We find that, overall, upper bounds for repertoire coverage of the
  major chant genres range between 50 and 80%. As expected, we
  find that Mass Propers are covered better than the Divine Office,
  though not overwhelmingly so. However, the accumulation curve
  suggests that those bounds are not tight: we find that ∼5% of chants
  in sources indexed between 1993 and 2020 were unique, so dimin-
  ishing returns in terms of repertoire diversity are not yet to be
  expected. Our study demonstrates that these kinds of questions can
  be addressed empirically to inform musicological data-gathering,
  and delineate promising areas of application for unseen species
  models in musicology."
