The cat is out of the bag: soon, I will start a new position 
as Assistant Professorship in Digital Music Philology and Music Theory
at Julius-Maximilians University Würzburg, Germany.
This is, of course, an exciting step forward in my academic career.
I am eager to meet with my new colleagues, get to know the musicology students,
and dive in into Franconian local culture.

There are plenty of opportunities for collaboration, especially but not limited
to the new Center for Digitality and Philology "Kalimachos".
Würzburg also has a renowned music conservatory and a vibrant cultural scene - the 
prestigious Mainfranken Theater being renovated at the moment

I have high hopes and ambitions goals for my time there, about which I might 
write in more detail in the future. For now, there are many things 
to do related to onboarding, adminsitration, and preparation of course material. 
This term, I am teaching seminars on "Neo-Riemannian Theory" and "Music Memes".

Besides these news, I will (finally) try to write a bit more regularly, so that
maybe at some point this collection of posts might deserve to be called a blog.
