- very grateful to be invited
- task was to talk for 10 minutes
- keep it light but say something meaningful
- these rules are very subjective
- I am mostly talking with an **academic career** in mind
- let's discuss later / feel free to reach out!

## Rule #1

### Don't listen to just any advice

{{% speaker_note %}}

- I'm not saying "don't take **any** advice"!
- listen
- inform yourself
- make up your own minds
- I hope I can maybe inspire a thought or two

## Rule #2

### Use Git

{{% speaker_note %}}

- or any other version control system
- your colleagues will thank you
- the scientific community will thank you
- your future self will thank you
- plus: almost hard requirement for any software/data-related job
- it shapes how we think about achieving tasks and develop an agile mindset
- THINGS CHANGE

## Rule #3

### _Seriously_, use Git!

{{% speaker_note %}}

- I cannot stress enough how crucial this is!

## Rule #4

### Organize yourself

{{% speaker_note %}}

- being organized is one of the biggest assets
- continuous struggle
- todos: task lists
- material: file/reference management
- communication: email / social media / website / GH profile
- time management: agenda!
- CV
- why?: we're not always masters of our time

## Rule  #5

### If you write code, write packages not notebooks

---

## Rule #6

### Read one book a month

{{% speaker_note %}}

- Textbooks don't count!
- I am not exaggeration. Aim high!
- Books are a very poor medium: just text
- forces our minds to do the rest of the work
- it's like a gym for your creativity
- plus: you'll have something else to talk about

## Rule #7

### Waste time

{{% speaker_note %}}

- the most important rule of all
- do nothing
- play
- get rest (sleep/go on vacation)
- find your passion and follow it
- even when you're "supposed to be writing" (always?)

{{% /speaker_note %}}

## Rule #8

### Think about alternatives

{{% speaker_note %}}

- don't put all your money on one horse
- there are DH jobs but not too many
- academia is full, look elsewhere
- life means change, pace may be fast

{{% /speaker_note %}}

---

## Rule #9

### DH is a "big tent" --- don't forget your rations

{{% speaker_note %}}

- interdisciplinarity requires fundament in one's own discipline(s)
- this means also doing "analog humanities" occasionally
- going to archives
- talking to people
- visiting museums
- keeping track of what's happening in the world

{{% /speaker_note %}}

## Rule #10

### Look for and rely on friends

{{% speaker_note %}}

- this could easily have been Rule #1
- a degree is an individual work, but it's rarely possible without support
- especially if you are not a local!
- difficult times will come, it's good to have someone to rely on
- I am immensly grateful to my supervisors, my colleagues and friends, the students, and the admin staff here at EPFL

## Rule #11

### Don't let anybody tell you how many rules there are

{{% speaker_note %}}

- it is up to you!
