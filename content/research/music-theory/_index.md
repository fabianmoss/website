  Music theory investigates the fundamental structures, systems, and conventions that govern music. From harmony and counterpoint to form and notation, this field provides the analytical framework for understanding how music is composed, performed, and perceived. My research spans historical music theory, analytical approaches to tonal and post-tonal music, and the intersection of theoretical concepts with empirical study.
